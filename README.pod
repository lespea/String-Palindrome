=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 is_palindrome

Returns true if the string, array, or array_ref is a palindrome.  If more than
one parameter is passed to the function, then it will blindly assume that you
want to treat them as an array to be tested.  This means that you could,
theoretically, pass in a palindrome of array_refs and it would still pass.

If only one arg is passed, then it is first checked to see if it is an array
ref.  If it is an array ref it is treated as a normal array.  If it is a simple
scalar, then it is treated as a string.  If it is any other type of ref, then
undef is returned.  Additionally, a blank array ref also returns undef.
